# pipetree 0.4.1

## Modifications 

- Allow config path to be given using sys env variable.
- Change `load_merged_partitions()` to fetch the list of cached targets via `cache$list()` rather than `drake::cached(cache = cache)`, as it seems much faster.

## Minor

- Add more logs

# pipetree 0.4.0

  package version of the calling env, as well as the time at which the metadata was
  fetched.

- Add `load_merged_partitions`, for conveniently loading dataframes that have been 
  split into partitions, and combining the various chunks of each dataframe back into one.

# pipetree 0.2.1

- Added non-interactive mode for `get_project_metadata`, so it doesnt bust sessions

# pipetree 0.2.0

  `get_project_metadata`.
